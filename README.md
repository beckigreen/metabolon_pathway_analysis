# Quantitative and overrepresentation pathway analysis using Metabolon pathway assignment

---

~IN PROGRESS~

In the field of metabolomics, many metabolites are missing public identifiers, such as Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) or Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) IDs, making pathway analyses incomplete and subject to bias. 
 
Companies, such as _Metabolon Inc._, have annotated pathways to metabolites, which is based on their proposed biological function and informed by the KEGG database. This assignment can be used to perform pathway analyses, but there is a lack of functions in R that are able to do this using predefined pathways.

This repo includes (_in progress_):

A) Code for running overrepresentation analysis based on predefined pathways

B) Code for running quantitative pathway analysis based on predefined pathways - this approach has been used previously, see [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11306-015-0829-0#Abs1) and [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29901700/).
